## 📌 What Is SonicReader?

SonicReader bridges the gap between **static content** and **dynamic accessibility** by allowing users to upload a PDF and receive its audio version—ideal for those on the go, visually impaired, or who simply prefer listening over reading.

But unlike traditional platforms, SonicReader introduces **Web3-powered access**:

- 🔐 **Connect with Wallet** – Users authenticate using their Solana wallet such as Phantom, removing the need for emails or passwords.
- 💳 **Pay to Convert** – Through **Solana Pay**, users pay a small fee (in USDC) to convert each PDF file to audio.
- ✅ **Verify Payment On-Chain** – SonicReader confirms the payment via on-chain reference before proceeding with the conversion.
- 🔊 **Get Audio Output** – Upon confirmation, the converted audio is streamed or downloadable immediately from the interface.
